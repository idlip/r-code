#+title: Basic R learning notes
#+author: Dilip

/These are some of my initial R understanding notes, might be useful, might be another dump of basics. I'm not sure how this will be ny the time you see this repo./

I use nixos, so having flake for specified channels is good and also let it manage all packages and libraries!
Benefit of using flake here is, you will have the same exact (100%) setup like I have, same versions of everything. That is what *flake.lock* is for.

+ Development shell with mentioned packages via flakes
#+begin_src shell
  # option 1: with no cloning of repo
  nix develop "github:idlip/r-code"

  # option 2: inside local clone directory
  nix develop
#+end_src


+ TODO: Will make use of direnv too
+ TODO: Make use of literate org file for R learning with good documentation and index it in this readme.
