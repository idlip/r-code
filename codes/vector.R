## First we set vector to a variable (scores)
scores <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)

## This can also be assigned other way
c(2.4, 17.2, 18.2, 5.7, -5.5) -> y

## Note that R is case-sensitive. Scores and scores are different
## So that means, there can be 64 variables (2**6)
Scores

## Call correctly
scores
y

## print second element from the vector
y[2]

## print range from first to third element
y[1:3]

## Note: Index starts from 1 here. 0th index is just zero.
## unlike python, Index starts from 1
y[0:1]

x = 7
y = 2
v <- 2*x + y + 1
v

## square root function
## see similarly ?sqrt, log, exp, sin, cos, tan, abs
sqrt(v)
